		<h1>Modern Lifestyle Theme - Icon Set</h1>

    <div id="container">
      <p>The function of an icon is to simplify the image, it is usually a symbol of something. Icons are important nowadays because people can easily recognize them not only on technology devices but also in everything we see in our daily life.</p>
      <p>The theme of the icon set that I created is based on the modern lifestyle. There are 10 icons in this life set: calendar, camera, clock, email, messenger, music, note, recording, store and weather. Although these icons are simple plus people see them almost every day, the most important idea is the design concept. Every icon has its colour to represent itself. Because of their colourful feature, it usually catches people’s eyes. Furthermore, the edges of each icon are designed to be rounded because it is more comfortable for people when they are looking at them. </p>
